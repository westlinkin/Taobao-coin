Taobao coin
=========

<h4>An chrome extension to get Taobao coin automatically, at least it's the purpose</h4>

Now this is actually a very simple js file: open the ```auto_take``` page when the user opens ```www.taobao.com```, as shown in the code <a href="https://github.com/westlinkin/Taobao-coin/blob/master/get_coin.js">here</a>. If the user has logged in, coin will been auto token.

This is not a good extension I had to admit. Please help to make the project better. All the LAZY people need you :P
