Taobao coin
=========

<h3>An chrome extension to get Taobao coin automatically, at least it's the purpose</h3>


This is not a good extension I have to admit. Please help to make the project better. All the LAZY people need you :P

<h4>I want to use</h4>
You can download the .crx file <a href="https://github.com/westlinkin/Taobao-coin/blob/master/downloads">here</a>. If you don't know how to install the extension, click <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5919997/how-to-install-extensions-that-arent-from-the-official-chrome-web-store">here</a>.

<h4>I want to contribute</h4>
This is actually a very simple js file: open the ```auto_take``` page when the user opens ```www.taobao.com```, as shown in the code <a href="https://github.com/westlinkin/Taobao-coin/blob/master/get_coin.js">here</a>. If the user has logged in, coin will been auto token.

Feel free to fork and build.
